# End to End Ecommerce Chatbot Project: "Customer Service Chatbot for an Ecommerce Clothing Company"

# üõçÔ∏è E-Commerce Chatbot

An AI-powered customer service chatbot for e-commerce, built using **LangChain, Pinecone, Groq, llama3.3 70b model**. The chatbot provides product recommendations, processes orders, tracks shipments, and remembers past conversations for a seamless user experience.


## üöÄ Features
- **Product Recommendations**: Suggests products based on user queries and budget.
- **Order Processing**: Handles multiple items, calculates totals, and generates order confirmations.
- **Order Tracking**: Provides real-time order status updates.
- **Conversational Memory**: Retains chat history using **LangGraph** for better interactions.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Uses **Pinecone** for fast, relevant document retrieval.


## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Python** (Flask for Web Interface)
- **Selenium** (For Webscraping amazon website)
- **LangChain** (LLM integration & retrieval-augmented generation)
- **Pinecone** (Vector database for retrieval)
- **HTML & CSS** (Frontend for chatbot UI)
- **GROQ API** (GROQ for accessing Llama 3.3 70b model) 


## :bricks: Project Overview:  
**1. Data Collection:**    
    - The first step in our project was collecting product data from Amazon. This data includes product details, pricing, and other metadata.     
    - I used selenium to automate the webscraping process.    
    - collected real-world product data from Amazon using Selenium for web scraping. The dataset includes details for:    
          - Men's Formal Shirts    
          - Women's Sarees    
          - Men's Watches    
    - For each product, the following attributes were extracted:  
          - Brand Name  
          - Product Name  
          - Rating  
          - Rating Count  
          - Selling Price  
          - MRP (Maximum Retail Price)  
          - Offer/Discount  

**2. Data Cleaning:**
    - The collected data has to been cleaned.  
    - I have to handle the missing values as we will use the data to create a vector store and missing values negatively impact the reponse of our chatbot.  
    - Used mode (most occured value) to fill in the missing values.  
    - Majority of missing values were in the Rating column and Rating count.  
    - Some missing values were found in the Price column and MRP.  
  
**3. Pinecone Vector Store:**  
    - I used the nvidia embedding model "nvidia/nv-embedqa-mistral-7b-v2", accessed the model directly through nvidia website.  
    - Once embeddings has been setup, I create the pinecone vector index.   
    - Upload documents to the vector store.        

**4. Initiate LLM:** 
    - Used the **Groq** to access the "llama3.3 70b" model.  
    - Used groq because it enhances the speed of the response of an llm which is suitable for our chatbot.   
      
**5. Build Retriever:**
      - Load the pinecone vector store and initiate it as a retriever.  
      -  Our chatbot has to remember of the conversation, therefore we have to memory / history for the chatbot. Used the inbuild "chat_history" and "session_id" to build memory for the chatbot.  
**6. Deployment:**
      - Developed a Flask application to deploy the chatbot for real time access.   
      - Build an ecommerce website through html, css and integrated the chatbot in it.   
      - Handled the chatbot receive and response part through javascript.
