## :bricks: Project Overview:    
## 1. Data Collection: 
    
- The first step in our project was collecting product data from Amazon. This data includes product details, pricing, and other metadata.       
- I used selenium to automate the webscraping process.    
- collected real-world product data from Amazon using Selenium for web scraping. The dataset includes details for:    
    - Men's Formal Shirts    
    - Women's Sarees    
    - Men's Watches    
- For each product, the following attributes were extracted:  
    - Brand Name  
    - Product Name  
    - Rating  
    - Rating Count  
    - Selling Price  
    - MRP (Maximum Retail Price)  
    - Offer/Discount  
  
## 2. Data Cleaning:
    
- The collected data has to been cleaned.    
- I have to handle the missing values as we will use the data to create a vector store and missing values negatively impact the reponse of our chatbot.  
- Used mode (most occured value) to fill in the missing values.  
- Majority of missing values were in the Rating column and Rating count.  
- Some missing values were found in the Price column and MRP.  
    
## 3. Pinecone Vector Store:
    
- I used the nvidia embedding model "nvidia/nv-embedqa-mistral-7b-v2", accessed the model directly through nvidia website.    
- Once embeddings has been setup, I create the pinecone vector index.     
- Upload documents to the vector store.        
  
## 4. Initiate LLM:
  
- Used the **Groq** to access the "llama3.3 70b" model.    
- Used groq because it enhances the speed of the response of an llm which is suitable for our chatbot.     
         
## 5. Build Retriever:
  
- Load the pinecone vector store and initiate it as a retriever.    
-  Our chatbot has to remember of the conversation, therefore we have to memory / history for the chatbot. Used the inbuild "chat_history" and "session_id" to build memory for the chatbot.  
        
## 6. Deployment:
  
- Developed a Flask application to deploy the chatbot for real time access.      
- Build an ecommerce website through html, css and integrated the chatbot in it.     
- Handled the chatbot receive and response part through javascript.
